This is Aerith Netzer's blog, _Kyberwarlord_, it is an occasional blog that is mostly text-only. I post book and music reviews occasionally, and curate my digital garden here.

## About Me

I am a librarian with all my heart. I do a little bit of everything as a librarian except do any _actual_ librarianship. That does not mean I am not busy! I write code for a [couple](https://bulletin.appliedtransstudies.org/) [journals](https://www.rplrt.org/), and do research to make the publishing process easier. I also do data science/ML/AI work for the humanities! I bring big data perspectives to humanities conversations.

I am also just a little cat :3

A note on "AI": Having existed in the tech world and the library world, there are very polarized opinions on AI, and I think it is useless to be unilaterally for or against a technology itself. I also do not think that a lot of librarians really know what they are talking about when they talk about "AI". "AI" does not really exist, and I think we should try to be more specific when we speak of these things. When people complain about "AI", they are generally talking about generative large-language models (GLLM). I am certainly aware and can concede that there is a lot of (GLLM) slop out there, and I do not think that it is good to train models on something that the creator to which the author did not consent. However, I think these actions are primarily due to the current scam economy under which we currently operate, and are not inherent to GLLMs. GLLMs, and LLMs in general, have already proven themselves to be far more efficient than classical brute-force approaches in fields from biology to engineering to humanities.
