I am Aerith Netzer, the nominal Digital Publishing and Repository Librarian at Northwestern. This is part notebook, blog, and portfolio for my works in my professional and personal knowledge acquisition.

## More About Me

- You can view my [[./experience.md]] here.
- You can view my [[./education.md]] here.

Currently, I publish The Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies and a forthcoming journal in Slavic Literature. Further, I am part of a team that seeks to understand how literature and the arts can serve as a "stratigraphic record" in understanding human's reaction to the Anthropocene over time.

I have expertise in Python, particularly in supercomputing platforms such as SLURM to take advantage of the RAPIDSAI library by NVIDIA to accelerate humanities research. My digital publishing has given me valuable knowledge on web development and devops.
