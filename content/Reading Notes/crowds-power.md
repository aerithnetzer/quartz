Crowds and Power by Elias Canetti is concerned about crowds. How they form, what they do, and how they operate.

The opening to the book is very haunting, yet also illuminating. It highlights the anger, the hate, the violence with which one is filled when moving through a crowd.

> Man petrifies and darkens in the distances he has created.

The discharge is the moment when all inhibitions are lost and a crowd truly becomes that of a hive-mind. Something that is inseparable but also of distinct individuals.
