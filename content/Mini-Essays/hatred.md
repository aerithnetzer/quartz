title: On Hatred and Self

One of my earlier childhood memories is sitting in a car with my father. We are talking about some inane topic, maybe it was about the news, or maybe some music, or a movie. Something like that. I do not remember if anyone else was with us. Regardless, we are talking about some thing and I say something about how I hate that thing. My father turns to me while driving and asks me a question on why I hate everything.

Another core memory that I have, goes back to when I was no older than 7. My father had beat me in a game of HORSE, the basketball game. I told him that I hated him. Because I hate losing.

Another memory: I have done something wrong. I cannot remember what. I had gotten into a fight with someone, or I had said something offensive to someone. It doesn't particularly matter. My father said that I was not a good person. I can't say I disagree.

These memories seem to have become core to who I am as a person. I am someone who _feels_ a lot. Ever since I was a child, because I was perhaps more empathetic than the average young boy in suburban Texas, more sensitive and emotional. I cried a lot when I was a child at random events, going to church, seeing people in a store. I didn't really hate gay people, and that made me, by extension, a faggot. Plus one for nominative determinism. It is quite easy for me to be depressed or ecstatic or thankful. It is far easier, though for me to hate. Perhaps it is because hate is the only thing that I have been taught is good to feel. Hate for other, hate for the flesh, hate for the community. Feeling sad or empathetic or grateful is for fags.

I hate in a way that feels like no other emotion I have. When I was a child. I did not cry when I was sad. I did not really feel sad when my grandmother came into my childhood bedroom when I was 16 and said that my mother had died downstairs. I felt hate.

One of my mother's last experiences of me, four months before she died, was me getting arrested for shoplifting from a target. There was no reason for me to shoplift. I felt hate.

When my mother died, I was hiding in my childhood room playing a stupid game on a fucking Nintendo Switch. When my mother died, I was not sad. I did not really cry when I sat next to my father in front of my dead mother. I went to school the next day. I do not cry easily when I am sad. I cry much more easily when I am hateful. When my mother died, I felt hate.

I do not necessarily get angry at people. But I have searing hate. Going through a busy grocery store is a painful experience for me. Going on the train springs forth deep emotion, deep pain, and most all deep hate. It is not a violence, but a _disgust_ with other people.

My life has not necessarily been a particularly traumatic one in the modern usage of the word. I think that I simply feel hatred towards the universal traumas. 

The trauma of being born.

The trauma of realizing that the world is terrible outside your home.

The trauma of reckoning with death.

Each of these are traumas that I think are universal to all people. That being born was forced unto us. That we are shoved into a world, defenseless and shivering. That we are destined to die.

Dealing with these universal traumas, to me, is to hate. Yet the hate becomes contradictory and self-referential. I hate being born, it was forced upon me unwillingly, yet I hate that I must die, for it is also forced on me unwillingly. I hate my body, as it was forced upon me unwillingly.

Ironically, the thing I hate most of all about myself is my hate. I hate my feeling of hate. I hate that I feel such _disgust_ for the people around me. I hate that I hate myself. In such a cycle of hatred and distrust of myself, the only thing that I can do is front, to pretend to be something. To force myself to participate in the shared hallucination.

When people do something that upsets me. Or when people ask me something about myself, I lie. Instinctually, I say things that I somehow make myself believe are true. Things that I literally create memories for. Some of the lies are so old, and the memories are so finely created and implanted by my id into my superego that I cannot tell if it actually happened to me or not.

I have created my own hallucination. I have created a world of hatred and personal hell of which I am the sole inhabitant. There is no rhyme or reason as to why I feel such ways. I feel disgust with myself most of all. My disgust with myself, my self-induced mimetic psychosis drives out everyone. My fear of myself, of my body, of my mind, of others' bodies and minds, of the world, of the state, of the outside-of-myself.

There is deep sadness, and behind that curtain there is hate, and behind that curtain is fear. A fear that renders my body uninhabitable.

I do not know how to escape the primordial fears of other people that well up within me. How to stop feeling that I need to create false identities so that I can keep people from really knowing me. I do not know how to escape the hate that I have given myself. I do not know how to not be afraid.

Look what fear has done to my body.
