I had an interesting conversation with a friend of mine recently about the role that vendors and other external interests hold in the modern university. They have worked in a university setting far longer than I have, and it left an impression on me. They told me a story of how their university administration put greater weight on simply spending the money and getting the product than they did on the product itself. Put simply, they were measuring their success by how many products they got with however much money, rather than measuring the _efficiency_ and _efficacy_ of the product. This got me wondering what the mindset of some hypothetical administrator must be to place so much emphasis on spending the money in opposition to how the money is spent.This is likely going to eventually turn into a longer-form research project analyzing the political, economic, and psychological axes of what I am tentatively naming "the obsession with big numbers" within a university setting.

To understand the economic and psychological dimensions of the modern obsession with big numbers, we must first turn to the root of all other discourse---politics. One could argue that the economic and political aspects could be retro-genetically conjoined into their former progenitor, political economy. But here we are chiefly concerned with the structure of power in the modern university. This does not mean that the political is wholly distinct from the economic and psychological. On the contrary, each of these faces are merely different facets of interpreting how the world takes form. It is thus no surprise that the greatest of political, social, and post-Oedipal psychoanalytic theorists are able to deftly engage with all three simultaneously. I do not claim to be one of the great social critics, but merely to posit that there are multiple fronts of this war with which we must bravely engage.

Thusly, we begin at the political root, where we will engage with a company that holds immense power in the academic industrial complex, RELX. Analyzing how organizations like RELX are formed, governed, and perpetuated is seminal (in a psychoanalytic and chronological sense) to understanding how they have come to rule the modern academy with such success. We then discuss some potential political solutions that can be used to solve this problem.

Secondly, we engage with the economics of the modern university, particularly the lowering of state and federal funding for public education, and the increasing focus on the health of balance sheets at the expense of teaching and learning. As state and federal governments further austerity policy regarding higher education, reflecting decreased government faith in the academic system, we will look at how universities across the country, public and private, are responding to a dynamic market for education and the funding thereof. We will look to Yale, specifically their implementations of the Yale Model for institutional investing, the University of California Los Angeles, and Texas State University.

Finally, we delve into how people rationalize and contextualize their relationship with the academic industrial complex. This attempt is not a small one, and I surely will not be the end-all-be-all for this psychological analysis. But, I hope to show, in broad strokes, that we tend to follow an inertia of comfort, because one is afraid to eat shit and fail in the world of academia. It is my position that the modern librarian, and I will hazard a guess that this is a consistent observation throughout university departments, is mostly preoccupied by bullshit tasks that get fucking nothing done where everyone leaves a goddamn meeting thinking that overused _fucking_ phrase "_that could have been an email_." I assert that our uselessness and cowering before the almighty hands of Dutch company is not due to a lack of power, money, or talent. It is a lack of _ambition_. It is the satisfaction of being second-best, the satisfaction that one has done a good fucking job when they get a pat on the head from their boss for negotiating a fucking contract instead of sitting down and building it your fucking self.

As one can tell, I have some opinions. They begin presently.

## The Political Scheme

In the _Nicomachean Ethics_, Aristotle states that the purpose of politics is to maximize human _eudaimonia_, or to bring about the thriving of people. I do believe that there is some merit to this, and that all people likely believe this to some extent, but I would also hazard to say that most people say that the purpose of politics is to maximize one's own flourishing, without consideration of the fellow citizens of the _polis_. This "eudaimonic greed" is the firmament that supports the superstructure that is the current American tech industrial complex. Each organization has intense competing interests, and thus, through "rational" decision-making, each organization and by extension the individuals within the organization work to maximize their internal sense of human thriving, at the expense of all others.

One does not need to look far to see how organizations flay our passions in an agonizing torture. I do not think that very many librarians get into librarianship for the glory, fame, and other results of political success. Librarians, in my experience, tend to become librarians for the love of the game. Of course there are exceptions, but as librarians are the descendent of a highly feminized labor force, it is unsurprising that many academics see librarians merely in a service position as an object to be used rather than as a political subject.

The awfully-named RELX, which was formed after a series of consolidations in the publishing industry, aggressively preys upon nascent publishing players, swoops them up, and consolidates them. One need only look to the downfall of BePress, selling out to Elsevier. When young upstarts attempt to take on the status quo and upset the system, it seems that the spirit of Mark Fisher still haunts our times with the understanding the capitalism subsumes all critique, that there truly is no other way.[^1] Elsevier fucks the modern academic from two directions at the same time, once when an academic submits their work for no compensation in return, and again when universities pay a second time to the journal for the work they already payed a salary for someone to do! It's fucking embarassing! The fact that this is even tolerated should be due cause for firing everyone who has ever touched a resource administration or collection development position in the last 50 years! You should be embarrassed. Especially if you are in an elite university. The political power that we have just let publishers like Reed-Elsevier perpetuates a system where we allow profit-driven companies to do the thinking for us. They market their new products like a new shiny toy for a child on Christmas and we just give it to them. For what? So that we can brag on some library blog or jack off some donor about where their money spent?

Fuck off. Give me a break.

Elite universities have the unique advantage to do something remotely positive for once in their miserable existence. We can use the immense political power that we hold as elite degree-granting institutions to force our own alternatives. We have the technology, we have the resources, we have the skills, God knows we have the money. Why is it that we insist on purchasing some low-tier shit? It is my opinion that universities have wildly misinvested in resources from the private sector, when home-grown solutions can be cheaper and easier to use when one is so close to the end-users. 

## The Economic Scheme

There is a distinct lack of funding for higher education in current year.
