## Outline

Engaging critically with the dipole worlds of desire.

Talk about how this is a confrontation between the thesis and the antithesis. There is intellectual knowledge that the synthesis is the "best way." But no actual progress is made on this front.

## Introduction

For a while now, I have been attempting to engage critically with how I see myself _qua_ productivity. There is a certain part of me that creates (or attempts to create) certain fantasies and constructed scenes that justify my existence to the world. When conceived in the context of one another, they are extraordinarily messy scenes, my "character" flips back and forth between a chaotic force of nature---giving in to every impulse---and a rigid, robotic self that hates the humanity with which I have been given. This bimodality of self-consciousness creates senses of perpetual unease. That I am missing out on learning and creating all that I can when I give in to desire, and missing out on pleasurable experiences when I force myself to become a super-productive human machine. Intuitively, one can understand that there can exist an equilibrium between these two poles on the apollonian/dionysian spectrum. But the ambiguity is insufferable. It seems that there is an ever-present force within the mind that propels me towards the edges, the margins. I am unable to live in the borderlands, I am only able to live in one demarcation or another.
