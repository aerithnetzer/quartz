## Introduction

There is a plague against which we have failed to inoculate our students. It strikes silently, has no physical symptoms, and can only be recognized by a trained eye. Carriers of this plague are completely asymptomatic until they reach a very specific moment in their lives. To make it worse, some carriers never make it to this moment at all. The training to detect this plague is not taught in medical schools or in schools at all, and the site and time of infection can occur at any moment.

I am speaking, of course, of Chromebooks. These devices have caused untold damage to the public's understanding of computing, and the cost of this damage is staggering to behold. All of the tiny efficiencies add up to staggering magnitudes of time and money. The proliferation of browser-based tools for everything from writing letters to friends to creating forecasting models in spreadsheets to publishing groundbreaking research has negatively affected the pace, quality, and pedagogical value of digital scholarship.

Google Docs and Microsoft Word are like the Fisher-Price cars that children have, when you want to get _real_ work done, you have to splunk for moreâ€¦ esoteric truths.

## Some Context

I am a librarian. More specifically, I publish journals for Northwestern University. I prefer to keep my knowledge very broad, and so I could never actually be a scientist. But, I regularly interact with faculty, students, and staff and often get great insight to their research methodology. These people are surely not stupid, after all they are performing ground-breaking research at an elite institution. But they don't know what they don't know. They don't spend most of their time thinking about the textual encoding of citations so that it can be indexed by database services. They don't obsess over the little persistent identifiers and trackers that allow librarians and research offices to track the impact of their work. This has always been the value-add that publishers such as Elsevier, Springer, and the rest of the unholy alliance provide.
