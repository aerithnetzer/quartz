Skinny Puppy's late-1980s record _Rabies_, and its most popular track, "Worlock", concocts a concentrated sense of fear, obsession, and tragic loneliness layered between deep bass drumming that mimics a pounding headache that follows intense emotional release. This artificial aural environment is hostile, even difficult to listen to, but the compulsion to listen is sourced from the very raw emotion that comes between verses in the chorus.

> _That's all they see Blue_

> _Shifting peace_

_Skiiny Puppy, "Worlock", on Rabies (1989)_

There is a definite break in the flow of the music at the end of the chorus, as if being cut off and choked mid-refrain of "a view so cruel."
