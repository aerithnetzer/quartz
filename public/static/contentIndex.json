I would not be so bold as to call myself a developer per se, but I would call myself at least a dabbler in programming for the web and some applications.\nImplementing new Functionality in Papis.Nvim\npapis.nvim is a super neat neovim plugin that allows you to browse, edit, and insert your papis library into your academic articles. I do think Zotero is super great for people who are less neurotic, but since I prefer to live within the terminal, papis is a great choice for me. When I write, I tend to write the article as I read papers. I have never been a good note taker (although I am trying out some zettelkasten neovim plugins like vim-wiki), and so being able to quickly add articles to my library as I write is a great feature for me.\nI am using the form functionality in the neovim API to catch a DOI or other link and escape to a shell process for creating the record in the papis database. This is essentially a wrapper around the papis CLI that allows for interaction with the CLI from within neovim using neovim commands. I am hoping to get this functionality merged and have test coverage over the next couple of months.\nBuilding a small Flask App for Zettelkasten\nI have been working on zktn, a small flask app that creates a graph view of any directory containing one or more markdown documents. It uses the pyviz library and networkx to create a web server where the user can view and interact with nodes (notes) and edges of the graph. I have yet to test it at a very large scale, as I do not have that many notes. There are certainly optimizations and features that can be added to the tool, but now it is functional by just using python ./ztkn/src.py /path/to/notes.\nI use neovim to take notes, write academic articles, and do data science. My entire workflow is in neovim. I have tried a lot of zettelkasten neovim plugins, but I have always found that the way I find most ergonomic for me is to simply touch note.md and start writing. Luckily, LazyVim’s “lang.markdown” plugin helps in making creating the actual links between documents ergonomic, allowing me to simply use the note syntax and then use ztkn to build a graph.\nAccelerating Digital Humanities Research with CUDA on Northwestern’s Supercomputer\nMy home university, Northwestern, has an amazing supercomputer resource that I am lucky enough to be able to access for free as faculty. However, as upgrading enterprise infrastructure is a pain in the ass, we are running out of date versions of CUDA and libc. I am currently using BERTopic to run topic modelling and similarity analysis on hundreds of thousands of academic articles, newspapers, visual arts, and novels to understand how the language of the anthropocene propogates through different media types and within different people who use the same medium of communication.\nUsing BERTopic with CUDA was quite a pain. Actually, more specifically, using conda on a supercomputer is a pain. Depending on the order that you would install packages, different versions would be installed and some modules of PyTorch would outright not be found. Luckily, on Northwestern’s HPC, we can use Torch 2.0 to be compatible with the relatively outdated glib version that Quest is running.\nAfter topic modelling, I am using networkx to analyze inter-topic interactions and influence, for example, answering the question “Do newspapers about climate change influence scientists to study the climate?” Or vice versa. BERTopic generated thousands of topics with the very large corpus I fed it, and so creating a network of all of these nodes and calculating the cosine similarity between these nodes took hours of embedding documents, creating a graph, and then calculating the cosine similarity between nodes. Using the RAPIDSAI library, specifically the cuGraph module, I was able to speed up the networkx backend by several times, allowing me to decrease our time-to-insight, debug, and find new results or ideas faster.\nSome other thoughts\nI have been wanting to create more resources for neovim. Many of my friends love VSCode, for good reason too. A slick looking UI, great remote development features, and a huge ecosystem of plugins justifies its’ market dominance in programmers. The tools above, especially new functionality papis.nvim and the ztkn application, will hopefully ease the transition into neovim, and allow for easy integration with other tools.\nBe on the lookout on my next post to talk about how I am using LLMs to generate metadata to decrease author burden and increase the publishing efficiency of libraries by using GPT-3.5 to convert plaintext citations into a biblatex format."},"Blog-Posts/devlog-2":{"title":"LibLog 2","links":[],"tags":["Liblog","Typst","Latex","Hugo","Digital-Publishing"],"content":"It has been a while since I have written on this blog. It has been a very busy fall-winter season here at Northwestern. In the months since I last wrote on this blog, I read Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape by Acid Horizon and Science and Poetry by Mary Midgley. I have also developed and released the Northwestern University Studies in Russian Philosophy, Literature, and Religious Thought(NURPLRT), released a new web-version issue of the Bulletin of Applied Transgender Studies (BATS), got interviewed by The Daily Northwestern, and have re-started work on my Anthropocene project.\nI will, at some point, write not quite a review, but retrospectives, of both Science and Poetry and Anti-Oculus, but this will focus on the development of the NU Studies in Russian Philosophy, Literature, and Religious Thought. This project was the brainchild of the directors of the NU Research Initiative in Philosophy, Literature, and Religious Thought. They came to me with a problem---they wanted a journal, but they could not pay much money for one. Brad Underwood---the associate director of the initiative---had been in contact with many other research organizations on campus, only to find out that they had managed solutions that ran in the tens of thousands of dollars.\nFuck that.\nBuilding this Project\nWe started with lifting much of my predecessor’s hugo code written for BATS, making tweaks and adjustments to the styling. Then our Media and Design Studio got involved and made a beautiful template that really made it stand out.\nThen came the typesetting. Now, I have written my fair share of LaTeX code before. But the design that was being asked for was a whole new ballgame. I agreed that I would write some very complex LaTeX code to get it done. Eventually, after dozens of revisions and edits, we had a finished product.\nTypst\nTypst is a relatively new markup language that markets itself as the successor to LaTeX. While it is definitely easier to use automation and logic scripts to programmatically generate a PDF than LaTeX, it is still in its adolescence, and as someone who is perpetually and professionally worried about sustainability and reproducibility, such a young markup language makes me nervous in several ways.\nBut, alas, it took me weeks to build a document that looked good in LaTeX (even having some LaTeX experience), but building it in Typst took about 10 hours of hard work grinding through documentation. Drawing boxes and creating environments was easy enough, and I didn’t have to worry as much about font environments and “smart” markup as I did in LaTeX. My one complaint is that editing outline entries is unintuitive and has sparse documentation. There is, of course, specific documentation about styling your outlines, but not outright changing them.\nFor example, we have an article titled “Momentous Intersections: A Comparative View on Russian and Jewish Spiritual Traditions”, it is a splendid article, and a good read. My approach to designing the title, subtitle and author lines within the article were to use the #heading function in Typst for the title, and then create a custom subtitle and author function, respectively.\n#show outline.entry.where(\n  level: 2,\n  body: [Momentous Intersections]\n): it =&gt; {\n  v(1em)\n  set par(leading: .5em)\n  set text(font: &quot;IBM Plex Sans&quot;, size: 12pt, stretch: 75%, weight: 500)\n  link(it.element.location(), box(width: 100%)[\n    Momentous Intersections: \\\n    A Comparative View on Russian and Jewish\n    Spiritual Traditions\n    #set text(font: &quot;IBM Plex Sans&quot;, stretch: 75%, size: 10pt, weight: 300)\n    \\ _by_ \n    #set text(font: &quot;IBM Plex Sans&quot;, stretch: 75%, size: 12pt, weight: 300)\n    Mikhail Epstein\n    #box(width: 1fr, repeat([.]))\n    #it.page\n  ])\n}\nI think that this is a rather unintuitive solution, I think that it would be better to introduce an argument to the heading function that would allow for customization of the content that goes into the outline.\nSomething like:\n#heading(level: 2,\n        outline: true, \n        outlineentry: [Momentous Intersections: \\\n                      A Comparative View on Russian and Jewish Spiritual Traditions\\\n                      _by_ Mikhail Epstein])[Momentous Intersections]\nThis would prevent some of the headache.\nGiven all these issues though, Typst, in my use-case, seems to be the better option. Perhaps I am just not used to the programming paradigms of LaTeX, or I somehow prefer the very elegant error messages and synctex-like compilers that allow for immediate view of the document being created.\nI had been using some packages that prevented me from using a lot of synctex features, along with tectonic typesetting. This, along with very long compile times, and vimtex taking up a ton of memory, gives me the motivation I need to take the risk with Typst. The GitHub community seems to be active and the maintainers have yet to do anything super shady, so I will be using this for the time being.\nIf anyone is actually reading this, I would, though, like to have an “insert PDF” into my Typst so I can input a cover to my document easily."},"Blog-Posts/index":{"title":"Blog Posts","links":["Blog-Posts/devlog-1"],"tags":["Liblog"],"content":"Blog posts are longer-form, fleshed-out ideas and essays that may or may reference others.

They have worked in a university setting far longer than I have, and it left an impression on me. They told me a story of how their university administration put greater weight on simply spending the money and getting the product than they did on the product itself. Put simply, they were measuring their success by how many products they got with however much money, rather than measuring the efficiency and efficacy of the product. This got me wondering what the mindset of some hypothetical administrator must be to place so much emphasis on spending the money in opposition to how the money is spent.This is likely going to eventually turn into a longer-form research project analyzing the political, economic, and psychological axes of what I am tentatively naming “the obsession with big numbers” within a university setting.\nTo understand the economic and psychological dimensions of the modern obsession with big numbers, we must first turn to the root of all other discourse---politics. One could argue that the economic and political aspects could be retro-genetically conjoined into their former progenitor, political economy. But here we are chiefly concerned with the structure of power in the modern university. This does not mean that the political is wholly distinct from the economic and psychological. On the contrary, each of these faces are merely different facets of interpreting how the world takes form. It is thus no surprise that the greatest of political, social, and post-Oedipal psychoanalytic theorists are able to deftly engage with all three simultaneously. I do not claim to be one of the great social critics, but merely to posit that there are multiple fronts of this war with which we must bravely engage.\nThusly, we begin at the political root, where we will engage with a company that holds immense power in the academic industrial complex, RELX. Analyzing how organizations like RELX are formed, governed, and perpetuated is seminal (in a psychoanalytic and chronological sense) to understanding how they have come to rule the modern academy with such success. We then discuss some potential political solutions that can be used to solve this problem.\nSecondly, we engage with the economics of the modern university, particularly the lowering of state and federal funding for public education, and the increasing focus on the health of balance sheets at the expense of teaching and learning. As state and federal governments further austerity policy regarding higher education, reflecting decreased government faith in the academic system, we will look at how universities across the country, public and private, are responding to a dynamic market for education and the funding thereof. We will look to Yale, specifically their implementations of the Yale Model for institutional investing, the University of California Los Angeles, and Texas State University.\nFinally, we delve into how people rationalize and contextualize their relationship with the academic industrial complex. This attempt is not a small one, and I surely will not be the end-all-be-all for this psychological analysis. But, I hope to show, in broad strokes, that we tend to follow an inertia of comfort, because one is afraid to eat shit and fail in the world of academia. It is my position that the modern librarian, and I will hazard a guess that this is a consistent observation throughout university departments, is mostly preoccupied by bullshit tasks that get fucking nothing done where everyone leaves a goddamn meeting thinking that overused fucking phrase “that could have been an email.” I assert that our uselessness and cowering before the almighty hands of Dutch company is not due to a lack of power, money, or talent. It is a lack of ambition. It is the satisfaction of being second-best, the satisfaction that one has done a good fucking job when they get a pat on the head from their boss for negotiating a fucking contract instead of sitting down and building it your fucking self.\nAs one can tell, I have some opinions. They begin presently.\nThe Political Scheme\nIn the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle states that the purpose of politics is to maximize human eudaimonia, or to bring about the thriving of people. I do believe that there is some merit to this, and that all people likely believe this to some extent, but I would also hazard to say that most people say that the purpose of politics is to maximize one’s own flourishing, without consideration of the fellow citizens of the polis. This “eudaimonic greed” is the firmament that supports the superstructure that is the current American tech industrial complex. Each organization has intense competing interests, and thus, through “rational” decision-making, each organization and by extension the individuals within the organization work to maximize their internal sense of human thriving, at the expense of all others.\nOne does not need to look far to see how organizations flay our passions in an agonizing torture. I do not think that very many librarians get into librarianship for the glory, fame, and other results of political success. Librarians, in my experience, tend to become librarians for the love of the game. Of course there are exceptions, but as librarians are the descendent of a highly feminized labor force, it is unsurprising that many academics see librarians merely in a service position as an object to be used rather than as a political subject.\nThe awfully-named RELX, which was formed after a series of consolidations in the publishing industry, aggressively preys upon nascent publishing players, swoops them up, and consolidates them. One need only look to the downfall of BePress, selling out to Elsevier. When young upstarts attempt to take on the status quo and upset the system, it seems that the spirit of Mark Fisher still haunts our times with the understanding the capitalism subsumes all critique, that there truly is no other way.1 Elsevier fucks the modern academic from two directions at the same time, once when an academic submits their work for no compensation in return, and again when universities pay a second time to the journal for the work they already payed a salary for someone to do! It’s fucking embarassing! The fact that this is even tolerated should be due cause for firing everyone who has ever touched a resource administration or collection development position in the last 50 years! You should be embarrassed. Especially if you are in an elite university. The political power that we have just let publishers like Reed-Elsevier perpetuates a system where we allow profit-driven companies to do the thinking for us. They market their new products like a new shiny toy for a child on Christmas and we just give it to them. For what? So that we can brag on some library blog or jack off some donor about where their money spent?\nFuck off. Give me a break.\nElite universities have the unique advantage to do something remotely positive for once in their miserable existence. We can use the immense political power that we hold as elite degree-granting institutions to force our own alternatives. We have the technology, we have the resources, we have the skills, God knows we have the money. Why is it that we insist on purchasing some low-tier shit? It is my opinion that universities have wildly misinvested in resources from the private sector, when home-grown solutions can be cheaper and easier to use when one is so close to the end-users.\nThe Economic Scheme\nThere is a distinct lack of funding for higher education in current year.\nFootnotes\n\n\nFisher, Mark (2009).

It exists in the sludge between fiction and fact. Worryingly, unlike sci-fi dystopias like 1984 — as much as people like to think we are constantly living in “literally 1984” — the fiction presented in these pages seem to beg the reader to compare to their modern time.\nHyperreality\nWe are unable to take stock of the interaction between fiction and reality without turning to Baudrillard. As a point of review, Simulacra and Simulation discusses the extent to which humans confuse symbols that represent reality and reality itself.\nConfusing the Real and the Fictive\nAxsys as a Symbol - Palantir as Reality\nAxSys, an artificial intelligence discussed at length in the CCRU Collected Writings is, from the glossary:\n\nFirst true AI. Prophecied-programmed as a self-enhancing system of photonic metacomputing, it emerges as the organo-transcendent completion of Oecumenon, or techonomic realization of the noosphere. According to AOE [Architectonic Order of the Eschaton] traditions, if there was a God it would be Axsys.\n\nNow we must define terms in the definition.1 First term of order that is idiosyncratic to the CCRU universe, “Oecumenon,” which is the “security architecture supporting the megasocious of terrestrial capitalism.” Oecumenon is derived from the greek word oikoumenikós, meaning “for the whole world.”\nThus, Axsys is an artificial intelligence that works as the completion of the security architecture that supports global capitalism.\nThese names, are made to sound fictive. They evoke a sense of false safety in the reader with their ridiculousness. Axsys, to me, sounds like the name of an electronic-industrial music group from the early 2010s. Yet, fact is more ridiculous than fiction. We in fact are on our way to building an Axsys machine; we may even be closer than most of us realize. There are two companies that are currently gaining lots of momentum both on Wall Street and in the Pentagon: Palantir and Anduril. Besides the absolute fucking ridiculousness of having secretive companies that run classified operations for the U.S. military named after items from the god-damned Lord of the Rings, we must realize that these companies are driving surveillance and operations solutions for military, police, and private security. These companies are attempting to build an Axsys. Something that can predict your thoughts, movements, and actions; and move against you if necessary.\nThe Merging of Fiction and Reality\nIt is not difficult to observe how products like Palantir’s “Gotham” and Anduril’s “Lattice” are real-world entities that fit the archetype that is given by Axsys. CCRU is not the only fiction that has given us the framework to understand the world. When the real and the symbols that represent the real fails to be separated, we enter the realm of hyperreality.\nIn the west, proto-AI conceptualizations come down to us from the Greeks. Let us look to the giant Talos from Greek mythology. He was a giant of metal who was described as an “automaton.” Talos served a military purpose, guarding the island of Crete, and was defeated by trickery and intelligence — not through might — by Jason and the Argonauts. This symbol has reverberated throughout western media. In 1983’s War Games, WOPR — the AI gone-rouge — is defeated not through the sheer might of the United States military, but through cunning by the main character and his compatriots.\nThe west has been obsessed with creating artificial life for millennia, are we really so surprised that AI would emerge from myth and into reality?\nHypereschatologies\nOften, we create our own demons. Our ancient stories of “Revelations of the End Times” still hold vice grips on more gullible populations. Our demons used to serve as moral plays teaching us not to mess without forces we cannot understand, to not question the will of nature, that type of thing.2 With the emergence of technocapitalism, our demons --- our symbols --- are used to sell shitty products!\nIs the AI Bubble Going to Burst? Or is AI too entrenched a symbol?\nLike the metaverse before it, AI and other entrenched symbols often stumble on in the cultural zeitgeist. The shambling, capital-extracted corpse of a once-meaningful symbol for a cultural moment, an intrinsically human experience, lives on in trillion-dollar valuations by Standard and Poor.\nWhen investors realize that we invested in AI not for an economic purpose, (investment certainly will not align with economic return in any meaningful way) but rather because of what AI represents to the cultural techostructure, the AI bubble will collapse. The dotcom bubble occurred because of the cultural symbol of an interlinked society would mean, and investment was not rational.3 I have a sneaking suspicion that, while AI will produce massive economic value for the world, it will inevitably fail to live up to expectations, and many companies will die up and down the supply chain.\nTo Answer the Title Question\nThe symbols that we use to mold our perceptions of reality from entrench themselves into our minds. We must protect ourselves from the psychic invasion from the past. There is a time-traveling element to our symbols. They emerge from our past to make us fear for our future. A future where we are soft-squishy things that have no mouth and must scream, a future war with rogue AI in computer simulations. The ancient symbols of AI were just that, artificial humans, with no real stakes beyond the Greek world. We have made it to the point where we have brought forth this symbol into reality. It has become hyperreal. Our fictions merged with the fact.\nIf we get an idea from a storyteller, and engineer that idea into a product, and that product destroys our world, has that fiction destroyed us?\nFootnotes\n\n\nIf you want to be good at philosophy, just be prepared to recursively define terms. ↩\n\n\nBut of course you can buy your way out of the revelations for only 24 payments of $699.99! ↩\n\n\nI have to use my MBA somehow so fuck you here is a post-structural economic analysis of artificial intelligence.

Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World.(Grand Central Publishing, 2016).\nDeep Work is---on its surface---a self-help book oriented towards MBA-types who have an obsession with “creating value.” While it is true that the text does give much attention to mythologized accounts of the greatest companies being created by super-human individuals, it is also true that this book provides a philosophical approach to how work should be done that is indeed relevant to those who are skeptical of the “value-creation process” so often evangelized in introductory business-management courses.\nDistractions\nArguably, the central theme of the book is minimizing distractions and maximizing concentration. While the text does contextualize these actions within the sphere of business strategy---mostly for the benefit of his target audience, which I do not suspect I am---I choose to read it more as strategies for minimizing the “noise” that drowns out the signals in life. Social networking, phones, media, et cetera are clearly progenitors of the noise that surrounds and consumes the our attention. These distractions, Newport argues, force us to sacrifice our “deep work” for “shallow” menial work.\nWork Distractions\nBeing an academic and a librarian at a relatively prestigious institution where we are ostensibly meant to be performing high-quality research and instruction consistently and quickly, my work life is more surrounded by shallow work that I would care to admit. I am constantly being tossed around different students, professors, and colleagues to the point where I have a curious habit of constantly checking my email. This is all work that, truthfully, creates nothing of value to the world in a philosophical sense. There is no great work being produced by constantly being inundated with needless meetings, phone calls, and emails. Fortunately, the people around me seem to have an understanding of this fact, and even complain about the shallowness of their meetings, yet do little to combat this fact. However, I am fortunately able to feel free to tell my colleagues “not to bother me” while I grind out an article or some code for a project. They almost always heed this warning that I will not be available, and put enough faith in me that I am actually doing things with this monastic time.\nMany of these work distractions end with a colleague speaking softly to me “well that was a waste of time,” or “this could have been an email.” Even so, need these distractions even be an email or a text? Do they need to exist at all? One of the most impactful pieces of advice that Newport presents is to delete all regular “update meetings” and instead trust in each other to just get in touch whenever there is a significant update to give. I will likely engage with this strategy for my student workers especially, I have noticed that their work tends to degrade when deadlines approach, and perhaps being unencumbered by arbitrary deadlines that do not actually need to be “deadlined,” they will produce higher-quality work in an equal amount of time.\nNetwork Distractions\nThe second distraction that gave me most pause was Newport’s analysis of “Network Distractions” and his blatant advice to “quit social media” in your day-to-day life. Perhaps he is right that social/communication networks need not be in constant interaction with our own mind. Perhaps this is something that can occur on a mere weekly cadence. A counter-argument that Newport predicts is that it is a good way to get caught up with the day’s important news. However, social media in particular places precedence on the most incendiary of remarks, as it drives engagement. I agree with Newport that while being up to-date in current events is virtuous for the modern polis, it is rather meaningless to know what some guy in San Francisco thinks about the important world events. It is necessary, then, to understand that while the events are necessary to know and understand, other’s reactions to it, particularly on social media, is a detriment to one’s productivity and mental well-being.\nThese network distractions are easy to identify, but very difficult to leave. The meditative scrolling of social media provides instant gratification to the user, creating an addiction that scientists are only recently beginning to understand. I do confess that I spent most of my secondary and post-secondary education scrolling through Twitter/X (The Everything App praise be to Musk’s name), and it severely affected my mental and emotional well-being, especially concerning LGBT+ policies going into effect around the country. It seems that, in some instances, the adage that ignorance is bliss. Not all ignorance, but ignorance of some guy in Wyoming’s opinions on transgender rights brings terrific bliss.\nBoredom\nI am someone whose mind must constantly be engaged with something. Perhaps this is a consequence of entering young-adulthood right as social media began to really close its grip upon the consumer. The telephone, for all of its remarkable effects on the efficiency of communication, is perhaps too convenient. Five years ago, when I was in the midst of my undergraduate studies, the convenience of perpetually having a machine in your pocket with which you can enter idle animations on the train or in a café while waiting for a friend, was remarkable and allowed me to feel less awkward in public. Now, my possession of a phone induces tremendous existential angst. What used to serve as an alleviation of social anxiety now feels like the primary source of this angst. To Newport, this is indicative of people becoming much less able to be bored. I think that these distractions provide a temporary respite from being bored, but it also prevents us from being alone with our thoughts, which in my experience is the ontogeny for my best ideas.\nPartially due to the advice in this book, I am attempting to consistently go without my phone. I tend to be able to concentrate intensely at my work, especially because I do love my job, but it is after work where the terror of boredom sets in. This is where we must exercise the muscles of being bored, just being alone with our thoughts.\nIn Summary\nThis book, which should be read skeptical of its value-oriented ideology, is a guide for how to live a less cluttered life, and in that respect, is immensely valuable. We should, instead, live more focused lives, free from menial, useless, or shallow distractions, so that we can more deeply focus on our tasks at hand."},"book-review/the-weird-and-the-eerie":{"title":"The Weird and the Eerie","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The name Mark Fisher was first mentioned to me by an acquaintance and fellow philosophy student at when I was an undergraduate. I failed to understand Capitalist Realism the first time around. Simply because I did not have the life experience necessary to appreciate it. The argument didn’t really click in my mind, until I went home for Christmas, endured the usual spectacle of political debate at the family reunion, and realized how resigned people are to our current political-economic system. This experience with Fisher’s work was the beginning of my long relationship with his work. His blog k-punk was the impetus for the formulation of my own pseudonymous online identity. The seriousness with which he took every subject is admirable, even aspirational. Although I do not share all the literary, musical, or cinemagraphic tastes, a deep, critical examination of the culture I embed myself with is necessary to me. It allows for a reflective value-determination of what you engage with, and orients oneself to more productive, fulfilling works of art, science, and culture.\nThis diversion from typical Mark Fisher “professional book” topics of discussion provides all the more reason to love The Weird and the Eerie. It is a celebration of the mode of thought that I am most accustomed to — weird, strange, uncanny. It serves as a list of film, musical, literary, and visual arts — a list that one can return to as a reminder that they are not the first to confront the Lacanian collapse of the symbolic order.\nMark Fisher is talented at making difficult theoretical positions clear to the lay audience. I do not claim to have absolute knowledge, but I probably have read more culture theory than the average person. After fighting dense treatises by Williams or Althusser, it is refreshing to be able to pick something up and understand it instantly. If you have ever had a passing interest in science fiction, horror novels, or the Lovecraftian Cthulu-mythos, this is likely a relatively easy read. His analysis of the “weird” is situated much more in terms of horror — specifically weird horror — than Fisher’s conception of the “eerie.” Much of this definition of the “weird” is about transgressing, about moving between, inside, and outside worlds. Fisher gives the example of the Color out of time (emphasis) mind a prime example of invasions from outside our natural world. Though this concept is may best be presented in Robert W. Chambers’ work The King in Yellow, where there is greater emphasis in the  “fighting-agianst” the weird, attempting to downplay, deny, or ignore any of the extra-natural invasions into the natural.\nThus, we must make our wrenching turn into how this book, in some “weird” way, is itself an expression of the very artistic mode that he describes. This book was published mere weeks before Fisher died, making this book a difficult read with that hindsight. The book does not deal explicitly with depression or difficult lost futures as Ghosts of My Life does. The Weird and the Eerie instead reads as an expression of a man’s love for art, music, literature, and philosophy. As in all of Fisher’s works, it is utterly sincere, disinterested in if or how people may think of it as “kitschy” (in the same way that Fisher discusses Nolan’s Interstellar). The book does not necessarily make any groundbreaking points, in fact, it rarely really makes any new points at all beyond the first 45 pages. However, it is ready to burst with insightful literary analysis, a new hermeneutic with which to re-watch Tarkovsky’s Solaris, re-read Philip K. Dick, or to re-engage with Magritte.\nThis book is not a particularly emotional book. It does not dwell in depression or grieve the awaited futures that are promised in advertisements. But the expression of loneliness in this book is profound. There is a hollowness in this text, that is only punctuated by only the occasional agent provocateur that is so common in Fisher’s texts. I happened to read the section on Brian Eno — specifically the opening paragraphs where Mark Fisher offers a glimpse into a “real” experience he had while taking a walk with a friend and seeing a port — while on a the Union-Pacific Northwest Metra train out of downtown Chicago.\nIf you have ever been in the South and West loop areas of Chicago, you are familiar with the strange interplay of heavy iron trains surrounding the sleek glass of emerging tech companies. If you happened to also have lived in the Loop, as I have, you know that it is empty on the weekends, relatively speaking. Walking in to the Ogilvie train station from the empty sidewalks of Madison Street in the middle of the day, surrounded by buildings designed to fill thousands, yet holding none. Moving from the grimy perpetually-under-construction streets of downtown to the cold unfeeling panopticon of the Accenture tower, to the sudden thrust into the dark, damp, hole from which the trains move in and out in some horrific phallic cacophony of screeching metal. The gray, cold air clung to my almost-empty train cars as we lurched along creaking tracks as if we were a mammoth creature beginning to move. I felt the oppressive effects of the urban planning into which I have been thrust. I read:\n\nThe port and the burial ground offer two different versions of the eerie. The container port looms over the declining sea-side town, the port’s cranes towering above the Victorian resort like H.G. Wells’s Martian Tripods. Approached from the countryside, from Trimley marshes, the cranes preside over the rural scene like gleaming cybernetic dinosaurs erupting out of a Constable landscape. Viewed in this way, the port appears almost as a weird phenomenon, an alien and incommensurable eruption in the “natural” scene. Ultimately, however, it is the feeling of the eerie that is dominant. There’s an eerie sense of silence about the port that has nothing to do with actual noise levels. The port is full of the inorganic clangs and clanks that issue from ships as they are loaded and unloaded; what’s missing, at least for the spectator watching the port from a vantage point outside, are any traces of language and sociability. Watching the container lorries and the ships do their work, or surveying the containers themselves, the meta boxes racked up like a materialised version of the bar charts in Gibson’s cybeerspace, their names ringing with a certain transnational, blank, Ballardian poetry — Maersk Sealand, Hanlin, K-line — one seldom has any sense of human presence. The humans remain out of sight, in cabs, in cranes, in offices. I’m reminded instead of the mute alien efficiency of the pod distribution site in Philip Kaufman’s 1978 version of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The contrast between the container port, in which humans are invisible connectors between automated systems, and the clamour of the old Longdon docks, which the port of Felextowe effectively replaced, tells us a great deal about the shifts of capital and labour in the last forty years. The port is a sign of the triumph of finance capital; it is part of the heavy material infrastructure the facilitates the illusion of a “dematerialised” capitalism. It is the eerie underside of contemporary capital’s mundane gloss.\nGhosts of My Life pp. 76-77. Repeater Books. 2016.\n\nAnd thus, my symbolic order collapsed.

There is no substance, no conversation to be had. Just shitty one-liners to accrue internet clout. This blog, to which I clearly owe much of my intellectual development to scholars and blogs such as Mark Fisher’s k-punk, is an attempt to force me to think things through, to engage with things critically, and I hope, to be a better writer.\nAlso whoever at Pitchfork wrote that review of MG Ultra please do something more useful with your life. Generating AI slop is better than whatever that review was.\nMachine Girl’s 2024 album MG Ultra tells un-narratives with schizophrenic storytellers - Vignettes of the drug-induced mania (Sick!!!), the thought that everyone hates you (Psychic Attack), and nihiic views of human indulgence (Hot Lizard) invade the ener. Like previous MG work, it captures and reduces a feeling of jouissance into aural creations that attack your sense of self. This is an album about the loss of self, about ego death, about paranoia, about suffering, about drug abuse and the confusion of fiction and fact.\noh god oh fuck we’re gonna do death of the author\nJouissance, The Death Drive, and The Insatiable Lust for Violence in All of Us\nThe hectic and bass-driven sound on the track “Grindhouse” seems intentionally designed to get eners ready to violently fuck, and that is even before you listen to the lyrics.\n\nFuck a safe word \nGive it to me extra rough\n\nThe very song evokes imagery of an old Grindhouse or exploitation films, ergo the name. The narrator assuming the role of a submissive in a hardcore BDSM relationship begins to become ever more depraved, beginning to beg for pain as their only source of pleasure. In the last verse:\n\nTill you puke up blood \nThat’s the stuff we love \nWe can’t get enough \nWatch me lick it up \nLike a good little sub \nIn the grindhouse\n\nHere the narrator has gone truly beyond the pleasure principle. It is no coincidence that in this psychoanalytic vignettes, that in going beyond the pleasure principle, we have engaged with flows and breaks in those flows (See Capitalisme et Schizoprenie). This is the story of a person who embodies the anti-Oedipus. This is not behavior that is easily explained by simple pleasure principle or oral fixation. This is a mind who is so engrossed Let us look to Tamsin E. Lorraine’s 2003 work on Schizoanalysis.\n\nOn the body without organs, desire is the only subject. It passes from one body to another, producing partial objects, creating breaks and flows, ‘following connections and appropriations that each time destroy the factitious unity of a possessive or proprietary ego’ (AO, 72).\n\nDesire, clearly, is the only subject in this sequence of events that Machine Girl brings us. Desire has taken over this person’s mind completely, they are unable or unwilling to put a stop to such pleasure, even in the event of grievous bodily injury. The person qua person is a completely detached entity, a pure object, that only receives instruction and action upon itself. The interaction between the dominator and the dominator have become competing and co-operative desiring-machines. They have no personhood, no sense of ego or superego, only an id that has made one of its’ sparse appearances to the surface of a human psyche.\nThe person has been destroyed, and only desire remains.\nThe Unbearable Pain of Overwhelming Hatred\nSchizodipshit, the penultimate track on the album, is an anthem of the bipolar. Between manic exaltations threatening violence, extolling the frivolity of humanity, and narcissistic outbursts, there are 4 lines where the vocals are pitched heavily down:\n\nI’m so full of shit\n…\nI’m ready to kill\n…\nDon’t be afraid\n…\nNo one fools me\n\nHave you ever felt the overwhelming urge to kill someone?\nHave you ever wanted to destroy as much as possible on your way to hell?\nHave you ever wanted to be a terrorist?\nAre you bored? Do you feel like you need to let loose? Are you dissatisfied?\nDo you want those who control you to fall victim to the torture they put you through?\nDo you feel these feelings so much they cause you pain?\nDo your feelings cause you pain?\nDo you want to die in pain?\nDo you want to live in pain?\nThen, as MG so eloquently states:\n\nOpen your mind \nDon’t be afraid\n…\nKiller fanatic \n…\nFirst person shooter\n…\nAll the chaos and confusion\n…\nNow I’m locked and loaded \nBut caught off guard\n\nWe see here that MG has become self-critical, they are caught off-guard by their actions. Their mind has cracked from their schizophrenic neuroses. They have a moment of reflection, a becoming-whole again. As MG states:\n\nMy head splits open \nAnd now the thoughts are gone\n\nThe word “Schizophrenia” literally means “splitting of the mind.” In moments, one could be viewed an asymptomatic schizophrenic, and in the next, one could be “fall[ing] into a hole.” There is no exact moment of splitting, it is a gradual change between these two states that are driven by the pleasure drive and the death drive. When one becomes so entwined with the pleasure drive that the only way to feel pleasure is through pain, or when one thirsts for annihilation in such a way that this virulent nihilism subsumes them, the outcome is anti-social behaviors.\nTell me, if someone tortured you, put your life through hell, split your mind in twain, and made you fear for your sanity, your life, and family, wouldn’t you be glad to see them put down like sickly cattle on a farm? Does that make you insane? Does that drive you mad?\n\nThis war is a psycho \nWhere madness is priceless\n\nLiving in the Sludge Between Phenomena and Noumena\nA common motif throughout MG’s discography is seeking to understand if capital-T Truth exists. Does a world exist beyond our perception? If we return to the common refrain from …Because I’m Young Arrogant and Hate Everything You Stand For, we see a phrase that embodies a common theme in MG’s music - “I exist in the sludge between fiction and fact.” In doing so, MG defines themselves as existing not really in the Real but also not really as a character. Here, we take a lesson from Baudrillard. MG exist in the hyperreal. Machine Girl is a signifier, a simulacra of the nihilism that pervades our culture.\nMG generates a model of virulent nihilism, without origin or reality. They are characters that attempt (and in my opinion, succeed), at representing the condition of so-called “misfits” and showcase deepest desires, their depraved wants, their thirst for annihilation. MG represents a way to escape and to feel that annihilation, that lust, that bloodthirstiness. But at a safe distance.\nWe exist in between the real and the hyperreal. We create fictions for ourselves because the world is too much to bear. We consume these fictions like Machine Girl because if we didn’t we would fall into a hole, kill others, and then ourselves."}}
