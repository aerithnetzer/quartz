I would not be so bold as to call myself a developer per se, but I would call myself at least a dabbler in programming for the web and some applications.\nImplementing new Functionality in Papis.Nvim\npapis.nvim is a super neat neovim plugin that allows you to browse, edit, and insert your papis library into your academic articles. I do think Zotero is super great for people who are less neurotic, but since I prefer to live within the terminal, papis is a great choice for me. When I write, I tend to write the article as I read papers. I have never been a good note taker (although I am trying out some zettelkasten neovim plugins like vim-wiki), and so being able to quickly add articles to my library as I write is a great feature for me.\nI am using the form functionality in the neovim API to catch a DOI or other link and escape to a shell process for creating the record in the papis database. This is essentially a wrapper around the papis CLI that allows for interaction with the CLI from within neovim using neovim commands. I am hoping to get this functionality merged and have test coverage over the next couple of months.\nBuilding a small Flask App for Zettelkasten\nI have been working on zktn, a small flask app that creates a graph view of any directory containing one or more markdown documents. It uses the pyviz library and networkx to create a web server where the user can view and interact with nodes (notes) and edges of the graph. I have yet to test it at a very large scale, as I do not have that many notes. There are certainly optimizations and features that can be added to the tool, but now it is functional by just using python ./ztkn/src.py /path/to/notes.\nI use neovim to take notes, write academic articles, and do data science. My entire workflow is in neovim. I have tried a lot of zettelkasten neovim plugins, but I have always found that the way I find most ergonomic for me is to simply touch note.md and start writing. Luckily, LazyVim’s “lang.markdown” plugin helps in making creating the actual links between documents ergonomic, allowing me to simply use the note syntax and then use ztkn to build a graph.\nAccelerating Digital Humanities Research with CUDA on Northwestern’s Supercomputer\nMy home university, Northwestern, has an amazing supercomputer resource that I am lucky enough to be able to access for free as faculty. However, as upgrading enterprise infrastructure is a pain in the ass, we are running out of date versions of CUDA and libc. I am currently using BERTopic to run topic modelling and similarity analysis on hundreds of thousands of academic articles, newspapers, visual arts, and novels to understand how the language of the anthropocene propogates through different media types and within different people who use the same medium of communication.\nUsing BERTopic with CUDA was quite a pain. Actually, more specifically, using conda on a supercomputer is a pain. Depending on the order that you would install packages, different versions would be installed and some modules of PyTorch would outright not be found. Luckily, on Northwestern’s HPC, we can use Torch 2.0 to be compatible with the relatively outdated glib version that Quest is running.\nAfter topic modelling, I am using networkx to analyze inter-topic interactions and influence, for example, answering the question “Do newspapers about climate change influence scientists to study the climate?” Or vice versa. BERTopic generated thousands of topics with the very large corpus I fed it, and so creating a network of all of these nodes and calculating the cosine similarity between these nodes took hours of embedding documents, creating a graph, and then calculating the cosine similarity between nodes. Using the RAPIDSAI library, specifically the cuGraph module, I was able to speed up the networkx backend by several times, allowing me to decrease our time-to-insight, debug, and find new results or ideas faster.\nSome other thoughts\nI have been wanting to create more resources for neovim. Many of my friends love VSCode, for good reason too. A slick looking UI, great remote development features, and a huge ecosystem of plugins justifies its’ market dominance in programmers. The tools above, especially new functionality papis.nvim and the ztkn application, will hopefully ease the transition into neovim, and allow for easy integration with other tools.\nBe on the lookout on my next post to talk about how I am using LLMs to generate metadata to decrease author burden and increase the publishing efficiency of libraries by using GPT-3.5 to convert plaintext citations into a biblatex format."},"Blog-Posts/index":{"title":"Blog Posts","links":["Blog-Posts/devlog-1"],"tags":["Liblog"],"content":"Blog posts are longer-form, fleshed-out ideas and essays that may or may reference others.

There is no substance, no conversation to be had. Just shitty one-liners to accrue internet clout. This blog, to which I clearly owe much of my intellectual development to scholars and blogs such as Mark Fisher’s k-punk, is an attempt to force me to think things through, to engage with things critically, and I hope, to\nAlso whoever at Pitchfork wrote that review of Nu Nu Meta Phenomena please do something more useful with your life. Generating AI slop is better than whatever that review was.\nMachine Girl’s 2024 album Nu Nu Meta Phenomna tells un-narratives with schizophrenic storytellers - Vignettes of the drug-induced mania (Sick!!!), the thought that everyone hates you (Psychic Attack), and nihilistic views of human indulgence (Hot Lizard) invade the listener. Like previous MG work, it captures and reduces a feeling of jouissance into aural creations that attack your sense of self. This is an album about the loss of self, about ego death, about paranoia, about suffering, about drug abuse and the confusion of fiction and fact.\noh god oh fuck we’re gonna do death of the author\nJouissance, The Death Drive, and The Insatiable Lust for Violence in All of Us\nThe hectic and bass-driven sound on the track “Grindhouse” seems intentionally designed to get listeners ready to violently fuck, and that is even before you list to the lyrics.\n\nFuck a safe word \nGive it to me extra rough\n\nThe very song evokes imagery of an old Grindhouse or exploitation films, ergo the name. The narrator assuming the role of a submissive in a hardcore BDSM relationship begins to become ever more depraved, beginning to beg for pain as their only source of pleasure. In the last verse:\n\nTill you puke up blood \nThat’s the stuff we love \nWe can’t get enough \nWatch me lick it up \nLike a good little sub \nIn the grindhouse\n\nHere the narrator has gone truly beyond the pleasure principle. It is no coincidence that in this psychoanalytic vignettes, that in going beyond the pleasure principle, we have engaged with flows and breaks in those flows (See Capitalisme et Schizoprenie). This is the story of a person who embodies the anti-Oedipus. This is not behavior that is easily explained by simple pleasure principle or oral fixation. This is a mind who is so engrossed Let us look to Tamsin E. Lorraine’s 2003 work on Schizoanalysis.\n\nOn the body without organs, desire is the only subject. It passes from one body to another, producing partial objects, creating breaks and flows, ‘following connections and appropriations that each time destroy the factitious unity of a possessive or proprietary ego’ (AO, 72).\n\nDesire, clearly, is the only subject in this sequence of events that Machine Girl brings us. Desire has taken over this person’s mind completely, they are unable or unwilling to put a stop to such pleasure, even in the event of grievous bodily injury. The person qua person is a completely detached entity, a pure object, that only receives instruction and action upon itself. The interaction between the dominator and the dominator have become competing and co-operative desiring-machines. They have no personhood, no sense of ego or superego, only an id that has made one of its’ sparse appearances to the surface of a human psyche.\nThe person has been destroyed, and only desire remains.\nThe Unbearable Pain of Overwhelming Hatred\nSchizodipshit, the penultimate track on the album, is an anthem of the bipolar. Between manic exultations threatening violence, extolling the frivolity of humanity, and narcissistic outbursts, there are 4 lines where the vocals are pitched heavily down:\n\nI’m so full of shit\n…\nI’m ready to kill\n…\nDon’t be afraid\n…\nNo one fools me\n\nHave you ever felt the overwhelming urge to kill someone?\nHave you ever wanted to destroy as much as possible on your way to hell?\nHave you ever wanted to be a terrorist?\nAre you bored? Do you feel like you need to let loose? Are you dissatisfied?\nDo you want those who control you to fall victim to the torture they put you through?\nDo you feel these feelings so much they cause you pain?\nDo your feelings cause you pain?\nDo you want to die in pain?\nDo you want to live in pain?\nThen, as MG so eloquently states:\n\nOpen your mind \nDon’t be afraid\n…\nKiller fanatic\n…\nFirst person shooter\n…\nAll the chaos and confusion\n…\nNow I’m locked and loaded \nBut caught off guard\n\nWe see here that MG has become self-critical, they are caught off-guard by their actions. Their mind has cracked from their schizophrenic neuroses. They have a moment of reflection, a becoming-whole again. As MG states:\n\nMy head splits open \nAnd now the thoughts are gone\n\nThe word “Schizophrenia” literally means “splitting of the mind.” In moments, one could be viewed an asymptomatic schizophrenic, and in the next, one could be “fall[ing] into a hole.” There is no exact moment of splitting, it is a gradual change between these two states that are driven by the pleasure drive and the death drive. When one becomes so entwined with the pleasure drive that the only way to feel pleasure is through pain, or when one thirsts for annihilation in such a way that this virulent nihilism subsumes them, the outcome is anti-social behaviors.\nTell me, if someone tortured you, put your life through hell, split your mind in twain, and made you fear for your sanity, your life, and family, wouldn’t you be glad to see them put down like sickly cattle on a farm? Does that make you insane? Does that drive you mad?\n\nThis war is a psycho \nWhere madness is priceless\n\nLiving in the Sludge Between Phenomena and Noumena\nA common motif throughout MG’s discography is seeking to understand if capital-T Truth exists. Does a world exist beyond our perception? If we return to the common refrain from …Because I’m Young Arrogant and Hate Everything You Stand For, we see a phrase that embodies a common theme in MG’s music - “I exist in the sludge between fiction and fact.” In doing so, MG defines themselves as existing not really in the Real but also not really as a character. Here, we take a lesson from Baudrillard. MG exist in the hyperreal. Machine Girl is a signifier, a simulacra of the nihilism that pervades our culture.\nMG generates a model of virulent nihilism, without origin or reality. They are characters that attempt (and in my opinion, succeed), at representing the condition of so-called “misfits” and showcase deepest desires, their depraved wants, their thirst for annihilation. MG represents a way to escape and to feel that annihilation, that lust, that bloodthirstiness. But at a safe distance.\nWe exist in between the real and the hyperreal. We create fictions for ourselves because the world is too much to bear. We consume these fictions like Machine Girl because if we didn’t we would fall into a hole, kill others, and then ourselves."}}
