    <description>The name of this blog, kyberwarlord is not meant to invoke the image of a red-teamer looking for vulnerabilities in a network. Further, the name need not even be about computers or the digital realm at all.</description>

    <title>Deep Work Review</title>

    <description>Newport, Cal. Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World.(Grand Central Publishing, 2016). Deep Work is---on its surface---a self-help book oriented towards MBA-types who have an obsession with “creating value.” While it is true that the text does give much attention to mythologized accounts of the greatest companies being created by super-human individuals, it is also true that this book provides a philosophical approach to how work should be done that is indeed relevant to those who are skeptical of the “value-creation process” so often evangelized in introductory business-management courses.</description>

    <title>Crowds and Power</title>

    <description>Crowds and Power by Elias Canetti is concerned about crowds. How they form, what they do, and how they operate. The opening to the book is very haunting, yet also illuminating.</description>

    <description>This article spoils War Games (1983). I recently finished CCRU Writings, 1997-2003, and came away with many conflicting, confusing, and conspiratorial thoughts.</description>

    <description>It has been a while since I have written on this blog. It has been a very busy fall-winter season here at Northwestern. In the months since I last wrote on this blog, I read Anti-Oculus: A Philosophy of Escape by Acid Horizon and Science and Poetry by Mary Midgley.</description>
